# hunt_the_wumpus_bash
The classic Hunt The Wumpus game written in bash.

The idea was taken from *Clean Architecture: A Craftsman's Guide to Software Structure and Design* by Robert C. Martin. He wrote:

> program so simple, that it could be implement in 200 lines of KornShell

(in my polish translation: *(...) absurdalnie prosty program, który mozna by zaimplementować w 200 wierszach kodu powłoki KornShell*)

I would like to check if it is true, but I used bash shell instead of KornShell.

As you can see - Martin was right.
